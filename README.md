# Car-price-prediction-
Built a web application that predicts used car prices based on key features like age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and transmission. Implemented ensemble learning with a Voting Regressor combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, and integrated it with a Flask-based interface for real-time prediction.
